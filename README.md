# Watershed & Stream Delineation Tool

This tool allows a user to delineate watersheds and streams based on an input Digital Elevation Model (DEM) raster using ArcGIS pro. The tool is built on ArcPy script, an ESRI Python package to extend the functionalities of ArcGIS products. There are two ways in which outlet(s) (pour points) can be used to delineate watersheds and streams: 1) using ALL outlet(s) identified in the DEM raster automatically, 2) using specific outlet(s) defined by the user. To provide outlet(s), the user can use a shapefile containing point features or select point(s) on the map.
