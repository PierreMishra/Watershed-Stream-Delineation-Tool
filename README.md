# Watershed & Stream Delineation Tool

This tool allows a user to delineate watersheds and streams based on an input Digital Elevation Model (DEM) raster using ArcGIS pro. The tool is built on ArcPy script, an ESRI Python package to extend the functionalities of ArcGIS products. Delineation can be processed by in two ways: 1) using all the outlet points identified in the DEM raster, 2) using user defined outlet(s). The user can provide an outlet shapefile containing point features or select point(s) on the map.
